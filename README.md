🧩 API & Frontend Containerization Workflow

This project demonstrates how to containerize a full-stack web application with a Node.js (Express) backend API and a React frontend, using Docker and Docker Compose for orchestration.

The goal is to show how multiple services (API + Frontend) can run together seamlessly in isolated containers, making deployment and collaboration simple for teams.

🚀 Project Overview

Backend: Node.js + Express REST API serving JSON data

Frontend: React app fetching data from the backend

Containerization: Dockerfiles for each service

Orchestration: Docker Compose used to connect both containers

Ports:

Frontend → localhost:3000

Backend → localhost:5000
