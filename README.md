# api-frontend-containerization
This project demonstrates how to containerize a full-stack web application with a Node.js (Express) backend API and a React frontend, using Docker and Docker Compose for orchestration.  The goal is to show how multiple services (API + Frontend) can run together seamlessly in isolated containers, making deployment and collaboration simple for teams.
